# Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64) - January 10, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 10 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP64 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP64 is part of the ongoing fulfillment of one of the mandates of the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001). The part which it fulfills is “Bug Bounty Program”, where IS-001 will orient its growing community of security researchers on the Immunefi bug bounty platform towards the Maker ecosystem. The program will attract whitehat hackers who find vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose them, so they are fixed before they can be exploited. Additionally, this provides an incentivized opportunity for disclosure of vulnerabilities instead of exploitation for blackhat hackers.*

* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, January 27.
