# Inclusion Poll for Adding MakerLabs Core Unit (SNUNK-001) - October 11, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, October 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MakerLabs Core Unit (SNUNK-001) being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

### MIP39c2-SP21

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Good, new products usually emerge from high-risk endeavours. In the world of traditional software engineering, building a Minimum Viable Product either validates or invalidates your product idea. However, real validation is gained from the market when the MVP is released to the public. Real validation is not the promise to use the product but only the product usage itself.
 While the current setup of the Maker DAO allows for incremental and low-risk improvement of the existing product, the current framework is not set up for pursuing revolutionary product ideas.
 Therefore we propose a new MakerLabs Core Unit that implements new product ideas spanning across the full stack of decentralized technologies. 
 Having full technological responsibility inside a single Core Unit would give MakerLabs the autonomy to move fast and ultimately test and validate new ideas early.*

### MIP40c3-SP32

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

### MIP41c4-SP22

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*I joined the crypto ecosystem pretty late (winter 2017) but learned about Maker quite early as there were very few projects around. The idea of taking a loan on a collateral in a permissionless way, without a man in the middle and by that providing a pegged asset into the volatile crypto market was very appealing to me so I started following and using the product. I believe we did a great job so far on focusing on the core without getting distracted too much. However, I think we should start running more experiments - something MakerLabs can support.*
