# Poll: Rates Proposal - November 15, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [MakerDAO Open Market Committee](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) changes: 
* Increase the WBTC-A Stability Fee from 2.5% to 4.0%.
* Increase the WBTC-B Stability Fee from 5.0% to 7.0%.

*Note: WBTC-B has not been onboarded at the time of this poll. If approved, this poll would update the [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) that was voted on [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmSL1kDq?network=mainnet#poll-detail) when the Vault Onboarding is up for an Executive Proposal.* 

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mid-month-parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-2021-11-10/11562) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These Stability Fee changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
