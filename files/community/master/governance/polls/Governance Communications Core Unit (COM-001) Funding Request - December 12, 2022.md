# Poll: Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP30). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Approving the winddown spending that includes compensation for the facilitator during January in addition to a few one-time expenses detailed in the offboarding proposal, despite the budget expiring on 2022-12-31.
* Note that no additional funds transfer would be needed, as this poll asks for permission to continue using the previous budget stream past 2022-12-31. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/govcomms-winddown-spending-permission/19067) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

* [Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP30) will be directed to continue using their budget stream past its expiration.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
