A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*I, @luca_pro, have been an active member of MakerDAO's community for a while, helping defining Maker's role along the crypto lending stack (also through the publication of the [Real-World Sandbox Report](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-sandbox-final-deliverable-for-consultation-round/11915?u=luca_pro)) as well as collaborating with several Core Units.
