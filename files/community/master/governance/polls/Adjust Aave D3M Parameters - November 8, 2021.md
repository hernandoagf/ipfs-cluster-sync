# Poll: Adjust Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Parameters - November 8, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Risk Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

* Increase DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) from 10 million DAI to 50 million DAI.
* Increase DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI [Target Available Debt](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) from 10 million DAI to 25 million DAI.
* Decrease DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Target Borrow Rate (`bar`) from 4% to 3.9%.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
