# Poll: Investigate on Offboarding of multiple collateral types - June 21, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 21 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the Mandated Actors should investigate a plan to offboard the following vault types:

* USDT-A
* UNIV2AAVEETH-A
* KNC-A
* UNIV2LINKETH-A
* LRC-A
* ZRX-A
* BAT-A
* MANA-A

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboard-unprofitable-collateral-types/8628) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following action will be taken:**
* The Mandated Actors will investigate a plan to offboard the above vault types from the Maker Protocol. 
* A future on-chain poll will ask the community to implement a specific proposal from the Mandated Actors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
