# Poll: MIP65 Asset Reallocation - October 24, 2022 

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Reallocate 250M DAI from [MIP65](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP65), initially allocated towards a mixed, medium-term focused, corporate and government bond investment mandate with Baillie Gifford, to [ISIN IE00BGSF1X88 : 0-1y US Treasury ishares/Blackrock ETF product](https://www.ishares.com/ch/institutional/en/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-mip65-asset-reallocation/18295) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote once processed by Monetalis and Collateral Engineering Services, as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
