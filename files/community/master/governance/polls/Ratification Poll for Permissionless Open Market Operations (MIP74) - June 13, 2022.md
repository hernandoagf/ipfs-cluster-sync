# Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, June 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP74 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP74 defines the process that will be used to agree and take action on a number of permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. The MIP proposes the utilization of the DssKiln module in order to make permissionless open market operations over a predetermined time period. The DssKiln module can be used for but is not limited to: (i) altering asset allocations of the surplus buffer, (ii) DAO treasury management, and/or (iii) management of possible future funds controlled by Core Units or other bodies of MakerDAO. For example, the DssKiln is able to perform certain actions that the Maker community has previously proposed and discussed, including an alternative mechanism for MKR burning, and/or purchasing ETH with DAI from the surplus buffer.*
