### MIP39c2-SP22

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This subproposal adds a Data Insights Core Unit (“DIN”), responsible for providing free and permissionless datasets based on detailed Maker Protocol history.
 This subproposal has been updated from the original version following very constructive discussion and feedback in the Forum and directly from Core Units and Delegates. The main changes are to reduce the scope (and therefore team and budget requirements) to “core” activities only, and with a focus on Core Units as the main consumer, rather than the wider community, and to increase the independence of the Core Unit.*

### MIP41c4-SP23

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*My name is Tomek Mierzwa.
 I have over 20 years of experience with data engineering, data quality management, data governance and business intelligence.
 For almost two years I’ve been leading the Data Services team in the Foundation. I had a pleasure to work with many of you, providing information and insights, answering questions and building data related products. With the help and inspiration of many people I created the EthTx.info transaction decoder as well as the MCDState, MCDGov and Liq2.0 datasets.
 Currently, after leaving the Foundation I’m involved in building Token Flow, a venture dedicated to monetizing blockchain data inside and outside the DeFi ecosystem. I believe I’m well suited to become a part-time Facilitator of the Data Insights CU and serve MakerDAO with my experience with data and the Protocol.*
