# Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, August 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP15 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"The original motivation for this amendment was to simplify and to clarify the Core Unit offboarding process. Recent examples (see MKT-001 offboarding: [1](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp49-modify-core-unit-budget-mkt-001/12059/12), [2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c5-sp3-facilitator-offboarding-mkt-001/12058/11), [3](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/content-production-core-unit-offboarding-post-mortem/13756)) have demonstrated several gaps in this process. Ratifying simple changes started small and, along the way, the ambitions grew into revisions for much of the Core Unit MIP Set. Thanks to generous contributions from GovAlpha we now have a cohesive MIP Set. The aim is to reduce harm to the DAO and community in the event of Core Unit disruptions."*

*"These changes are an attempt to make processes more transparent and orderly. In addition, edits to [MIP38](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38), [MIP39](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39), and [MIP41](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41) fill in process gaps, or streamline them, with additional documentation and/or templates. This comprehensive set of changes should inspire substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote. It will also make tracking and editing Core Unit MIPs simpler."*
