# Poll: Open Market Committee Proposal - August 29, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [MakerDAO Open Market Committee](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 29 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* Abstain - Voters should rank this as their first and only option if they do not wish to indicate preference over the outcome of this vote.
* Option 1 - Voters should rank this option in their order of preference if they support the indicated changes, detailed below. 
* Option 2 - Voters should rank this option in their order of preference if they support the indicated changes, detailed below.
* No changes - Voters should rank this option in their order of preference if they support no parameter changes being applied as a result of this poll. 

### Option 1

- Increase the WSTETH-B [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) from 100 million DAI to **200 million DAI**.
- Increase the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) from 5 million DAI to **50 million DAI**.
- Increase the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A [Target Available Debt](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) from 3 million DAI to **10 million DAI**.
- Decrease the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) from 2.25% to **2.0%**.
- Decrease the MANA-A [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) from 6% to **4.5%**.

### Option 2

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-25-august-2022/17448) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, this change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
