# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Set DAI Market Maximum Loan-to-Value to Zero Percent - November 6, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Scope Facilitator. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 6 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The SparkLend Ethereum DAI market already has [Loan-to-Value (LTV)](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#loan-to-value) / [Liquidation Threshold (LT](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#liquidation-threshold)) values set to 1bps. The proposal concerns reducing the LTV to zero percent (0%) to completely remove the ability to use the DAI market as collateral. It has no impact on utility as the sDAI market will continue to be available as a collateral asset.

Express your support or opposition to setting the DAI market Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) parameter to **zero percent (0%)** on SparkLend Ethereum. 

For more information about this proposed change, please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-to-adjust-sparklend-parameters/22542) and [BA Labs' risk analysis](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-parameter-change-mainnet-dai-market-ltv/22562).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

* Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to set the DAI market Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) parameter to zero percent on SparkLend Ethereum.
* An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
