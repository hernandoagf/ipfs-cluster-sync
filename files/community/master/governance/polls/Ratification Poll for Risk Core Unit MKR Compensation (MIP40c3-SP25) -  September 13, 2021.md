# Ratification Poll for Risk Core Unit MKR Compensation (MIP40c3-SP25) -  September 13, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, September 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to Risk Core Unit MKR Compensation being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This proposal contains:*

* *Retroactive MKR Compensation*
* *Team MKR Compensation Plan*
* *Payment Implementation*

*Our proposal is based on "Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines" by @Aes but it also uses elements from “An (Alternative) MKR Compensation Plan” made by SES Core Unit. This proposal differs from other proposals, since it assumes one time retroactive MKR compensation payment for 2 Core Unit members, explained further.*
