# PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - May 30, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [MakerDAO Open Market Committee](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 30 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following parameter changes: 

**[Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) Changes**
- Reduce WSTETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling from 300 million DAI to 200 million DAI.
- Reduce DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Maximum Debt Ceiling from 300 million DAI to 100 million DAI.
- Reduce LINK-A Maximum Debt Ceiling from 100 million DAI to 50 million DAI.
- Increase MANA-A Maximum Debt Ceiling from 10 million DAI to  15 million DAI.

**Other Changes**
- Reduce DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI [Target Borrow Rate](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit#target-borrow-rate-bar) from 3.5% to 2.75%.
- Increase WSTETH-B [Target Available Debt](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) from 15 million DAI to 30 million DAI.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-27-may-2022/15410) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
