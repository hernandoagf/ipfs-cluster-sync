# Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP60) - March 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, March 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP60 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This budget consists of two key parts, retroactive compensation for @LongForWisdom and an MKR Compensation framework for GovAlpha. Overall, this proposal would commit 227.64 MKR to GovAlpha contributors, covering MKR compensation for the Core Unit from its inception. This is approximately 67.06 MKR/FTE/Year. Subsequent requests will take place every 6 months, featuring the same 12-month cliff. Contributors do not forfeit their vesting upon leaving GovAlpha, providing that their departure is a smooth transition and there have been no serious ethical breaches.*
