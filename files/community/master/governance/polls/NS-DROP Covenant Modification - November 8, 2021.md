# Poll: NS-DROP Covenant Modification - November 8, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO governance community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The proposed changes to the NS-DROP covenants are as follows:
1. MakerDAO's maximum share of the NS-DROP pool will increase from 75% to 85%.
2. The Asset Originator (New Silver) will maintain a minimum share of 50% of the NS-TIN pool.
3. If the Asset Originator (New Silver) does not maintain a minimum share of 50% of the NS-TIN pool, MakerDAO's maximum share of the NS-DROP pool will revert to 75%.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increase-the-makerdao-ns-drop-maximum-to-85-when-ao-tin-participation-is-at-least-50/11134) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The NS-DROP covenants will be modified according to the outcome of this poll.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no change will be made to the NS-DROP covenants at this time.**
