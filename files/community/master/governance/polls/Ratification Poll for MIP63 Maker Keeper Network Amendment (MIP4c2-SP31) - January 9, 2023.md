# Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) - January 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 9 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP31 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*After successful trial run of the beta version of MIP63, there are a few learnings that I want to incorporate for the next iteration. Specifically, more strictly defining how payments are sent and buffers reported as well as changing a few parameters. Iâ€™ve also added an explicit stream duration as previously this was just assumed to be 6 months. The Sequencer can also set custom windows per network now.*
