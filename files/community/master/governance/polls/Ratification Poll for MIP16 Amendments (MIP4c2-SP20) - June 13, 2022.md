# Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) - June 13, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, June 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP20 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This change has been proposed to give engineering and governance teams greater time to confirm, write and include protocol changing parameters into spells in a much safer and less pressured manner than has been done previously.*

*We are also taking the opportunity to recognize that Governance Facilitators may elect not to have an Executive Vote in weeks when there are no significant changes required in the Maker Protocol. While this power could be inferred previously, by including it in MIP16 this process is made more transparent.*

*This subproposal amends the Weekly Governance Cycle Breakdown defined in MIP16c2 and, consequently, an amendment is appropriate rather than a complete replacement MIP.*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, June 30. 
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).

**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**
