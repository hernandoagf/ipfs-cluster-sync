# Poll: MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 5 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Distributing a total of 121.42 MKR to two former members of the [Real-World Finance Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#real-world-finance-rwf-001-).
* Funds would be split the distribution, with 73.32 MKR to @teejâ€™s wallet and 48.1 MKR to @eumenes wallet.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-mkr-pro-rata-vesting-community-sentiment-poll/17350) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
