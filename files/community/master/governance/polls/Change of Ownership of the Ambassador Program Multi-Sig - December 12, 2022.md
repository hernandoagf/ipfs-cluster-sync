# Poll: Change of Ownership of the Ambassador's Program Multi-Sig - December 12, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Replacing @kat as a signer on the [Ambassador's Program Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF411d823a48D18B32e608274Df16a9957fE33E45) with @Sebix.
* This would effectively replace the point of contact for the program as well, with future updates expected from @Sebix. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/change-of-ownership-of-the-ambassador-programs-multi-sig/19087) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Ambassador's program comptrollers will be instructed to replace @kat as a signer on the Multi-Sig with @Sebix.
* Future program updates (including expenditures) will be expected from @Sebix. 

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
