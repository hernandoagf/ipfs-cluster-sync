# Poll: Onboard dewiz as an Incubating Ecosystem Actor - March 27, 2023

The Arbitration Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system as directed by [MIP106](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP106). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) has been posted as per [MIP106c2.6.6.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP106#6-6-current-incubating-ecosystem-actors) and will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 27 at 16:30 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**
