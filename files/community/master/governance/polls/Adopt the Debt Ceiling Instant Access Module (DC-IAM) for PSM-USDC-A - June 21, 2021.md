# Poll: Adopt the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) for use with PSM-USDC-A - June 21, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 21 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adopting the [Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM)](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) for use with PSM-USDC-A with these initial parameters:
* Set Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`) to 10 billion DAI
* Set Target Available Debt (`gap`) to 1 billion DAI
* Set Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`) to 24h

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-psm-usdc-a-for-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-the-peg/8601) to help inform your position before voting. 

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module functionality will be added to PSM-USDC-A in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
