# Poll: Rates Proposal - February 28, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [MakerDAO Open Market Committee](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 28 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following parameter changes: 

**WSTETH-A**

- **Increase** the [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) from 200 million DAI to 300 million DAI.
- **Increase** the [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) from 20 million DAI to 30 million DAI.

**DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI**

- **Increase** the [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) from 220 million DAI to 300 million DAI.
- **Increase** the [Target Availible Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) from 50 million DAI to 65 million DAI.
- **Decrease** the [Target Borrow Rate (`bar`)](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-direct-deposit#configuration) from 3.5% to 2.85%.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-2022-02-24/13434) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
