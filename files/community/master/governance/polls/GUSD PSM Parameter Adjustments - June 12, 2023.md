# Poll: GUSD PSM Parameter Adjustments - June 12, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Scope Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Reduce the GUSD PSM [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) by 390 million DAI from 500 million DAI to **110 million DAI**.
* Reduce the GUSD PSM [Fee Out (`tout`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-psm#fee-out-tout) by 0.01% from 0.01% to **0%**.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/adjusting-psm-gusd-a-parameters-debt-ceiling-and-tout/21105) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
