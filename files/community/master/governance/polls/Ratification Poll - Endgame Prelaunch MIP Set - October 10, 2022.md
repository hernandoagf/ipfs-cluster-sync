### MIP83: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"MIP83 is a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set that configures the Clusters of the Launch MetaDAOs. This enables groups within the Core Units to begin preparations to restructure as MetaDAOs which is a de-risked form of scaling the Decentralized Workforce available in the Endgame."*

### MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"This MIP activates the preliminary implementation of the Protocol-Owned Vault, using the Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) approach which uses a non-standard configuration of the existing Maker Protocol to achieve the effects of a Protocol-Owned Vault."*

### MIP1c4-SP1: Subproposal for Changing the Problem Space

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"MIP1 was largely forgotten and never managed to serve its purpose, but with the Endgame Plan, the same core concept is revived as there needs to be clarity around precisely when Maker Governance starts to slow down and not invite so many proposals."*

### MIP4c4-SP1:	MIP Removal Subproposals

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"MIP6 and its related MIPs [MIP7, MIP8, MIP9, MIP11, MIP12] are being removed as a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP as these outdated processes have reached the point of causing far more harm than help. The original collateral onboarding process was not designed to accommodate the level of activity that is now occurring in Maker Governance, nor does it properly manage the risk of being overwhelmed with low-quality collateral onboarding proposals, which dominates and clogs up the current process."*

*"Continuation of the actual useful forms of collateral onboarding is already enabled entirely through the existing governance mandates and their ability to trigger relevant Executive Votes, as specified in MIP16, MIP39 and MIP41, but the Endgame Plan MIP Set also proposes additional amendments to further emphasize this existing capability and ensure that collateral onboarding can continue happening smoothly with no risk of unexpected blockers."*

### MIP4c2-SP27: MIP16 Amendment Subproposal

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"This MIP is being amended to become compatible with the Endgame Plan and prevent Signal Requests (non-standard weekly polls) from dominating the governance dynamic and acting as a vector for unpredictable complexity growth and governance overhead."*

*"This MIP Amendment only affects Signal Requests leading to non-standard weekly polls and doesnâ€™t change the standard and primary focus of MIP16."*

### MIP39c2-SP35: Modifying Risk Core Unit Mandate - RISK-001

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"The Risk Core Unit Mandate is modified as a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set in order to eliminate any possible risk of the collateral onboarding process becoming disrupted or blocked by the removal of the old MIP6 process."*

*"The updated mandate is written with a new approach where the critical element of the mandate that explicitly and directly impacts Facilitator Governance Powers are provided up front. This information is also described as short and succinct as possible in order to make it completely clear what Governance Privileges the Core Unit Facilitator will have with regards to proposing non-standard weekly polls as defined in MIP16."*

### MIP39c2-SP36: Modifying Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate (SF-001)

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:
