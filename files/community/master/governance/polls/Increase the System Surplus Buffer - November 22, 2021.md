# Poll: Increase the System Surplus Buffer - November 22, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 22 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.** 
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to rank their support for the following changes to the [System Surplus Buffer](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-system-surplus-buffer) (also referred to as the 'System Surplus'): 
* **Option 1:** Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 90 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million DAI per week.
* **Option 2:** Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 130 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million DAI per week.
* **Option 3:** Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 90 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 1 million DAI per week.
* **Option 4:** Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 130 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 1 million DAI per week.
* **Option 5:** No change to the System Surplus Buffer.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increasing-the-surplus-buffer-2021-11/11448) to help inform your position before voting.

More information on this parameter can be found [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol#surplus-auction).

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, then change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
