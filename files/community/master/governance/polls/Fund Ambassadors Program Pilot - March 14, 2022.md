# Poll: Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot - March 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* Funding an Ambassadors Program Pilot proposed by @kat. 25,000 DAI will be allocated for this pilot program if this poll and subsequent executive proposal pass.

A brief description of the Ambassadors Program has been provided by the proposal author:

*The MakerDAO Ambassador program provides non-english speaking communities with resources and educational materials to expand the MakerDAO community. Ambassadors provide two-way translation services, engage their communities with local events, and share content produced in their own language with the MakerDAO community. During the pilot, the ambassador program is focusing on Latin America with Ambassadors in Argentina and Venezuela.*

Implementation details for this program may be found in [this post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-fund-ambassadors-program-pilot/13199/14).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-fund-ambassadors-program-pilot/13199) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in the next available Executive Vote, following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
