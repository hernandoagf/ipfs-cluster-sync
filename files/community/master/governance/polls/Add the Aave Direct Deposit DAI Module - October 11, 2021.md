# Poll: Add the Aave Direct Deposit DAI Module - October 11, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding the Aave Direct Deposit DAI Module in the Maker Protocol with the parameters below:

### Initial Parameters

* [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam): 10 million DAI
* [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam): 10 million DAI
* [Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam): 12 hours

* [Protocol Engineering Core Unit Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/direct-aavev2-dai-direct-deposit-module-technical-assessment/10751)

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Aave Direct Deposit DAI Module will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
