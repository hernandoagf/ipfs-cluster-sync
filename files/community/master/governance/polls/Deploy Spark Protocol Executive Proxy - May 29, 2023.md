# Poll:Deploy Spark Protocol Executive Proxy - May 29, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 29 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the deployment and use of an Executive Proxy that will be used when updating Spark Protocol parameters.

Further information about the concept of Executive Proxies may be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/executive-proxies-and-spark-protocol/20976).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2023-05-24-spark-protocol-updates/20958) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* An Executive Proxy will be deployed for use with Spark Protocol.
* Permissions over Spark Protocol will be granted to this Executive Proxy as part of an upcoming Executive Vote.
* The Spark Executive Proxy will be used for future Spark Protocol configuration changes.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
