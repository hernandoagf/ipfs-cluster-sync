The Arbitration Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [Decentralized Collateral Scope Facilitators](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 3 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adding an exemption to the benchmark yield requirement defined in [MIP103c2.3.3.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP103#3-3-alm-rules-for-yield-collateral) (quoted below for convenience) for the following vault types:

- ETH-A

[MIP103c2.3.3.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP103#3-3-alm-rules-for-yield-collateral) states:

"Initially, the Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield is equivalent to the 3-month US Government Treasury Bill."

The process to exempt collateral from the Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield is defined in [MIP104c2.3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#3-1-risk-parameters-of-core-vaults).
