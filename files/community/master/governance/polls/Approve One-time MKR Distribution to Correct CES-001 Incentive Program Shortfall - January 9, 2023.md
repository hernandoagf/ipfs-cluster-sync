# Poll: Approve One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall - January 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit Interim Facilitator. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 9 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Send a one-time transfer of **96.15 MKR** to the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES-001) Auditor Wallet - [0x25307aB59Cd5d8b4E2C01218262Ddf6a89Ff86da](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25307aB59Cd5d8b4E2C01218262Ddf6a89Ff86da).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/request-to-poll-one-time-mkr-distribution-to-correct-ces-001-incentive-program-shortfall/19326) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
