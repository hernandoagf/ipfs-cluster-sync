# Poll: End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 10 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following change:
* Stop DAI funding for Sourcecred. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/poll-notice-signal-support-for-ending-dai-funding-for-sourcecred/18204) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* GovAlpha will discontinue funding for Sourcecred once the payments for October have been processed.
* Unused DAI will be returned to the Maker Protocol and alternative participation reward mechanisms will be investigated by GovAlpha.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then GovAlpha will continue to fund Sourcecred using the current system. An alternative proposal for reform of the program will be presented by the end of November.**
