# Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, November 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP88 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"MIP88 onboards a DAI 225M RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and acquire USD 225M of a super senior, front cash flow, AAAsf (or equivalent) rated RMBS on a bespoke basis (see Key Terms below). In addition, the transaction will be structured to provide 15% credit enhancement at closing for the super senior bonds."*

*"To maintain a consistent RMBS investment exposure level, a reinvestment program of cashflows into further Redwood Sequoia issuances on a bi-monthly basis is also activated. This includes operationalising a broader relationship with Redwood, including additional investment opportunities and collaborating with Redwood to develop a Clean Money aligned vision for RMBS."*

*"The legal, structural, and technical setup will be executed under a strict verification program."*
