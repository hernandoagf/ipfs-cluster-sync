# Poll: Select a Target Level of rNPI Profitability to Guide Budget Cuts - July 4, 2022

The Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 4 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* **Positive (>5%):** This would continue accumulating DAI in the [Surplus Buffer](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-system-surplus-buffer) and increase the short-term book value per MKR token. However, it may force the DAO to make cuts in Core Units with significant business continuity impact and reduce the ability of Core Units to maximize the opportunity at the end of the bear.
* **Break-even (Â±5%):** This would allow a small amount of flexibility to account for market fluctuations. However, it may occasionally have a negative impact on the [Surplus Buffer](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-system-surplus-buffer) in extend periods of narrow unprofitability.
* **Negative (minimum 3 years of runway at any time):** This allows a flexible framework for maintaining investment while still imposing a hard cutoff to control spending. However, it increases the possibility of extended drawdowns on the [Surplus Buffer](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-system-surplus-buffer).
* **No change:** This would reject all of the above options and continue the status quo.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-bear-building-financial-resilience-dao-targets/16004) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, the relevant Core Units will be tasked with implementing the outcome of this Governance Poll.
* Once an implementation plan has been decided further Governance Polls may be required, depending on the nature of the proposal.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
