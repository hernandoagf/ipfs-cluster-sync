# Poll: Delegate Compensation Trial - October 25, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO governance community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 25 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to trialing recognized delegate compensation for 3 months, starting in November. The compensation method for this trial can be found in [MIP61](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip61-delegate-compensation/10640), and will initially begin with the following parameters:
* Maximum Compensation Threshold: 10,000 MKR
* Maximum Annual Compensation: 48,000 DAI
* Exponential Factor: 0.5

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-trial-delegate-compensation-as-described-in-mip61-over-3-months/10978) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Payments to qualifying delegates will begin in November, distributed via executive vote at the end of each month.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
