# Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP11) - June 14, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, June 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to this proposal being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

The proposal in its entirety [can be found here](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/9a3f0e6842a27a38f0e7a56fc6cc1826b478f38b/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP12.md). The sentence summary and paragraph summary have been provided by the MIP author:

**Sentence Summary**

*MIP40c3-SP12 supersedes the budget for the Real-World Finance Core Unit defined in [MIP40c3-SP1](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp1-modify-core-unit-budget-real-world-finance/6225).*

**Paragraph Summary**

*With [MIP40c3-SP1](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp1-modify-core-unit-budget-real-world-finance/6225) the Real-World Finance team was able to onboard the first Real-World Asset and provide some financials for MakerDAO. Nevertheless, as no Legal Core Unit is expected in the short term, we need to increase the budget for legal expenses. We also need to solidify the data analytics part, which is currently limited, to integrate MakerDAO and RWA data to provide transparency and insights to stakeholders.*
