# Ratification Poll for Intangible Asset Assignment (MIP60) - February 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, February 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP60 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP60 sets processes for MakerDAO to determine which actors manage which Intangible Assets (such as web domains, GitHub repositories, and social media accounts). These processes are designed to be as lightweight as possible, requiring intervention by Maker Governance only in the case of disagreement between actors over the management of Intangible Assets. Included is a set of requirements for actors to meet when management control changes, and links to the records detailing which actors manage which assets.*

Please review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, March 3. 
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).
