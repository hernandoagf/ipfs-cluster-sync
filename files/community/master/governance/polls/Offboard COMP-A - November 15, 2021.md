# Poll: Offboard the COMP-A Vault Type - November 15, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* Lower the COMP-A [Liquidation Penalty (chop)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-penalty/) to 0%.
* Lower the COMP-A [Debt Ceiling (line)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling) to 0 DAI.
* Increase the COMP-A [Liquidation Ratio](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio/) over 30 days using dss-lerp such that all vaults are liquidated by the end of that period.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboarding-matic-comp-aave-and-bal/11184) to help inform your position before voting.

For additional information on the parameters that would be used to offboard this collateral, please see [this post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposed-offboarding-collateral-parameters-2/11548) from the Risk Core Unit.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
