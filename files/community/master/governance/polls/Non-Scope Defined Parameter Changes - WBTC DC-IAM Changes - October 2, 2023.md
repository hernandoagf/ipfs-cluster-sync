# Poll: Non-Scope Defined Parameter Changes - WBTC DC-IAM Changes - October 2, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 2 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes to the DC-IAM [Target Available Debt](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) (`gap`) parameter for WBTC vault types:

* Reduce the WBTC-A DC-IAM Target Available Debt from 10 million DAI to **2 million DAI**.
* Reduce the WBTC-B DC-IAM Target Available Debt from 5 million DAI to **2 million DAI**.
* Reduce the WBTC-C DC-IAM Target Available Debt from 10 million DAI to **2 million DAI**.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-6/22231) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

* These changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
