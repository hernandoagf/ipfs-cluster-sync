# Poll: Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [Dai Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP17). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* Abstain - Voters should rank this as their only option if they have no preference to any of the listed options.
* Daimon-Law - Voters should rank this option if they would like to see Paul Imseih (@Daimon-Law) elected to the DAI Foundation Board. You can view their candidate statement [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/candidates-for-dai-foundation-board-member-election-poll/18812#candidate-statement-for-daimon-law-1).
* 0xbocaJ - Voters should rank this option if they would like to see Jacob Minne (@0xbocaJ) elected to the DAI Foundation Board. You can view their candidate statement [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/candidates-for-dai-foundation-board-member-election-poll/18812#candidate-statement-for-0xbocaj-3).
* Neither Candidate - Voters should rank this option if they would support neither candidate being selected for the DAI Foundation. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/candidates-for-dai-foundation-board-member-election-poll/18812/1) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If "Daimon-Law" or "0xbocaJ" is the winning option, they will be nominated to the DAI Foundation Board by the MKR Voters.
* If "Neither Candidate" is the winning option, no further action will be taken at this time. 

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
