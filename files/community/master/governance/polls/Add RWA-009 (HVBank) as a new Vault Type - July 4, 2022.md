# Poll: Add RWA-009 (HVBank) as a new Vault Type - July 4, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 4 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding RWA-009 (HVBank) as a new vault type in the Maker Protocol with the parameters below:

### Collateral Parameters

* [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee): 0.0%

### Legal Documentation

A number of legal agreements are executed in advance of the Governance Poll - see [details](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/huntingdon-valley-bank-transaction-documents-on-permaweb/16264) - and are a necessary precondition to finalization of the definitive transaction agreements. The other transaction agreements will be executed subsequent to the Governance Poll but prior to the Executive Spell should the Governance Poll have a positive outcome (i.e. if votes for "Yes" exceed votes for "No").

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* RWA-009 (HVBank) will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
