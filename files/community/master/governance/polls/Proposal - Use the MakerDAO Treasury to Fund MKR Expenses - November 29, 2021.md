# Poll: Use the MakerDAO Treasury to Fund MKR Expenses - November 29, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 29 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* When possible, use MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury to fund expenses denominated in MKR.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-mint-new-mkr-for-protocol-expenses-or-fund-them-with-mkr-from-the-makerdao-treasury/11629) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Future MKR expenses will be paid from the MakerDAO treasury rather than using minted MKR unless governance explicitly votes otherwise.
* Existing MKR expenses that have been set up to be paid using minted MKR will be changed to use MKR from the MakerDAO treasury.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
