# Poll: Offloading TUSD-A - February 7, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.** 
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* Activate [liquidations](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/vaults/liquidation) on TUSD-A, causing currently undercollateralized vaults to be liquidated.
* Offload to a new TUSD-[PSM](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-psm#trade-offs) with 0 [Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-ceiling), allowing anyone to permissionlessly swap DAI for TUSD, but not allowing new minting of DAI from TUSD.
* Take no action at this time.
* Abstain.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offloading-tusd-a/12814) to help inform your position before voting.

For more information on TUSD, consider reviewing forum posts with the [TUSD tag](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/tusd).

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, then change will be included in a weekly Executive Vote, as the Protocol Engineering Team's schedule allows. 
* If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
