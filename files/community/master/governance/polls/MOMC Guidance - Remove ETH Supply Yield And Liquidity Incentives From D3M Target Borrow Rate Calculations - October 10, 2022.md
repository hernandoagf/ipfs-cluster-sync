# Poll: MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 10 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following change:
* Remove ETH supply yield and liquidity incentives from calculations when suggesting [Target Borrow Rate (`bar`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit#target-borrow-rate-bar) values to Maker Governance.

A concurrent poll will ask Governance to recommend a target spread between the D3M Target Borrow Rate (`bar`) and the Maker ETH-A borrow rate.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-modify-d3m-guidance-for-momc/18069) to help inform your position before voting.

For more information on how the spread is used to calculate the Target Borrow Rate (`bar`), please see the Maker Operational Manual entry [here](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit#spread).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MOMC will remove the ETH supply yield and liquidity incentives from the D3M Target Borrow Rate calculations.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
