# Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, August 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

### MIP40c3-SP73

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the Author and is shown below:

*"This Core Unit is authorized to spend $898,150 annually. Events are a 'nice to have' and not required for this bear market, particularly considering how Daivinity was executed. Mkr token holdersâ€™ money was spent on unknown attendees and no business deals or new hires have been credited to that event. Given current budget constraints, the protocol simply does not accrue value from a core unit whose mission statement is: 'To provide the best MakerDAO branded event experience to the crypto & Maker community including industry professionals, influencers, and enthusiasts'. And so this core unit should be granted severance and offboarded."*

The proposal author has proposed a one-off payment to the Core Unit of 103,336 DAI as a golden parachute in the event that the off-boarding is approved by MKR holders.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the Author and is shown below:

*See the [sister sub proposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp73-modify-core-unit-budget-events-001/15991) to remove the budget from this core unit. This core unit is simply not needed anymore. Severance is included in the budget offboarding sub proposal for both facilitators.*
