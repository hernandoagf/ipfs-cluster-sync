# Poll: Adjust BlockTower Credit Debt Ceilings - May 15, 2023

The Arbitration Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Ecosystem Scope Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following adjustments to the BlockTower Credit [Debt Ceilings](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-ceiling):
* Decrease the Debt Ceiling (line) of BlockTower S1 (RWA010-A) from 20 million Dai to zero Dai.
* Decrease the Debt Ceiling (line) of BlockTower S2 (RWA011-A) from 30 million Dai to zero Dai.
* Increase the Debt Ceiling (line) of BlockTower S3 (RWA012-A) from 30 million Dai to 80 million Dai.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-rwa-vaults-parameters-shift/20707) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the technical resource schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
