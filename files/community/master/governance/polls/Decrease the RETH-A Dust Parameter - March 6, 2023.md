# Poll: Decrease the RETH-A Dust Parameter - March 6, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Risk Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 6 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to modifying the [Debt Floor](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-floor) (also known as Dust) parameter for the RETH-A vault type:
* Decrease the RETH-A Dust Parameter by 7,500 DAI from 15,000 DAI to **7,500 DAI**.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/adjusting-reth-a-dust-parameter-march-2023/20021) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This parameter change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
