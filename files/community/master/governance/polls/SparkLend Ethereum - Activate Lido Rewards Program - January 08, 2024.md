# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Activate Lido Rewards Program - January 8, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to activating the Lido Rewards Program. This rewards program will send 20 wstETH (provided by Lido) to ETH market suppliers for 30 days starting when the activating spell executes.

Phoenix Labs-controlled multisig 0x8076807464DaC94Ac8Aa1f7aF31b58F73bD88A27 will be added as the admin for this program to avoid the programming starting and stopping due to having to wait on the Maker spell. This multisig will store the monthly wstETH balance to be distributed to simplify the administration.


Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-spell-proposed-changes/23298) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to include this change on SparkLend Ethereum.
* An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
