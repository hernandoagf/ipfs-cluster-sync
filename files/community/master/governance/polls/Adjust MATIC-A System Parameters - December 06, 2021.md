# Poll: Adjust MATIC-A System Parameters - December 06, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO [Risk Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP2). The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the MATIC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling and Target Available Debt as detailed below.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 06 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The two proposed adjustments to the MATIC-A vault type are as follows:
* Increase the MATIC-A [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) from 20 million DAI to 35 million DAI. 
* Decrease the MATIC-A [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) from 20 million DAI to 10 million DAI.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/matic-debt-increase-proposal-for-last-executive-of-2021/11989) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then these parameter changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
