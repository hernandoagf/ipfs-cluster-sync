# Poll: Prioritization Sentiment - Collateral Class - June 6, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Priority Sentiment Poll into the voting system on behalf of MKR holders. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 4 weeks beginning on Monday, June 6 at 16:00 UTC.


**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support for priority consideration.** 
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) for priority consideration.**
- **If you have no priority preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
- Broader Market Demand-Based Solutions - Solutions based on market demand sentiment for DAI outside of Maker. Example: Aave D3M.
- Real-World Assets Vaults - Vaults lending against Real-World Assets (as opposed to crypto assets). Example: New Silver.
- Real-World Asset Arrangers - Lending through arrangers that set up their own real-world loans based on criteria approved by Maker Governance. Example: 6s.
- Core Crypto Collateral - ETH and BTC implementations (including their derivatives). Example: Wrapped Staked ETH.
- Alternative Ethereum-based Crypto Collateral - Other ERC-20 crypto asset tokens. Example: LINK.
- Crypto Collateral from Other Chains - Lending against crypto assets on other chains/L2s. Example: OP (Optimism, not currently supported).
- Traditional Financial Instruments - Using Real-World Financial Instruments for backing DAI. Example: US Treasuries (Government debt, not currently supported).
- Peg Stability Solutions - Solutions designed to strengthen the DAI peg to the US Dollar. Example: USDC PSM.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/prioritization-framework-sentiment-polling/15554) to help inform your position before voting.

**Note: The voting portal will display the "leader" of the Ranked Choice Vote as the poll continues, and the "winning option" upon completion. These assertations should be ignored. For updates on the state of the vote, check below this text for the weekly updates from GovAlpha and live explorer from Data Insights.**

## Outcomes

**Weekly updates will be shared with the Maker Community to detail the feedback from Priority Sentiment Polls. No Governance action will be mandated upon their conclusion. GovAlpha hopes that these polls will:**
- Encourage more dialogue between MKR holders and Core Units about prioritization.
- Convey valuable MKR sentiment to those contributing to the DAO.

Suggestions for items to be included on future Priority Sentiment Polls may be submitted [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGMqLqzV-ySAiU_AhqeVuwGwgYFGpTYpEDvdNSzXo9Wi4U-w/viewform?usp=sf_link) along with additional feedback for the process as a whole.
