# Poll: Reserve Governance Facilitator Appointment - August 21, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system using their powers defined in [MIP113.7.1.4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-4-1). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 21 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an approval vote.**
- **You may vote for multiple options.**
- **You should vote for all options that you would support becoming a Reserve Governance Facilitator.**
- **Unselected options signal that you do not approve of those options.**
- **If you do not approve of any of the options, you should select "None of the above" as your only choice.**
- **If you wish to abstain, that should be your only choice.**

## Note on Display of Winners

Due to limitations of the voting portal frontend, we cannot display multiple winners if selected. Instead, the candidate with the most votes will be displayed. If up to three candidates each receive >50% approval, all candidates above 50% will be appointed as Reserve Facilitators. This will be confirmed off-chain in the MakerDAO forum.

If more than three candidates receive >50% approval, the three candidates with the highest approval will become Reserve Facilitators.

## Review
