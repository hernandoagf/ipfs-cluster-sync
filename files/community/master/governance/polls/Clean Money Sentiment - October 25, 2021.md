# Poll: Clean Money Sentiment - October 25, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO governance community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for **seven** days beginning on Monday, October 25 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the general direction laid out in the post '[The Case for Clean Money](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684)'.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-would-you-like-to-see-makerdao-move-in-the-general-direction-indicated-by-the-post-the-case-for-clean-money/10932) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

The outcome of this poll is **non-binding** and does not reflect an obligation for MakerDAO to implement any part of said post. It is intended to indicate the sentiment towards this direction among MKR Holders, such that the MakerDAO community can take this information into account in their actions over the following few months.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Further governance actions will take place to narrow down the contents of '[The Case for Clean Money](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684)' to one or more actionable and binding proposals which will then be presented to the community for voting.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
