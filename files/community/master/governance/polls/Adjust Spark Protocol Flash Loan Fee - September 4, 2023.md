# Poll: Adjust Spark Protocol Flash Loan Fee - September 4, 2023

The Reserve Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 4 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following change:
* Adjust Spark Protocol [Flash Loan Fee](https://docs.sparkprotocol.io/developers/guides/flash-loans#flash-loan-fee) by 0.09% from 0.09% to **0%**.

The Flash Loan Fee was reset to 0.09% as a result of the last pool upgrade. The aim of this poll is to revert it back to its previous value.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/upcoming-spell-proposed-changes/21801) and the [Spark Protocol documentation](https://docs.sparkprotocol.io/developers/guides/flash-loans) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
