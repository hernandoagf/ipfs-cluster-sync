# Ratification Poll  for Modify Dai Foundation Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP74) - August 8, 2022 

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, August 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**

- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

*"This Budget Proposal for DAI expenses aims to fund the activities of the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) as described in [MIP39c2-SP17 adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP17).
