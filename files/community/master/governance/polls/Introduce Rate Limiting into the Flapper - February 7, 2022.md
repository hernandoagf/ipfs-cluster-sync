# Poll: Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper - February 7, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* [Modify the Flapper-Contract](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rate-limited-flapper/13056) by introducing a rate limit so the protocol can control the amount of parallel running flap-auctions.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-bring-back-the-mkr-burn/12837) to help inform your position before voting.

If you wish to view the current state of this proposed modification, please see this [pull request](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/pull/244).

To learn more about the Flapper-Contract, please see this [technical documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/system-stabilizer-module/flap-detailed-documentation).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This modification to the Flapper will take place in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* Parameter recommendations for the Rate Limiter will be proposed by the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state?), requiring a further successful on-chain poll before advancing to an executive vote. 

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
