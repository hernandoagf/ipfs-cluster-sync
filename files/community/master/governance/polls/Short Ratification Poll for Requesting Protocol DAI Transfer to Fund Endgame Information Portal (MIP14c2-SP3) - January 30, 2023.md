This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 30 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

*Currently, information about the Endgame Plan and transition is fragmented and exists in a plethora of forum posts, often with multiple versions and their comments, Discord messages, and Youtube videos of Zoom call recordings.*
