# Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c19-SP1: Update Oracle Expiration Time for All Oracles - May 30, 2022

On behalf of the Oracles Core Unit, the Governance Facilitators have placed this poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP16](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 30 at 16:00 UTC.

Due to ambiguity in [MIP10](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP10) Subproposals and 0-day RFC and Frozen requirements, this proposal has been permitted to enter the weekly cycle with the addition of the [Minimum Positive Participation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#MIP51c2) requirement.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP10c19-SP1 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*The frequency of Oracle Medianizer updates is a function of the spread and expiration parameters. The Oracle Core Unitâ€™s analysis of Oracle costs found that the expiration timer accounted for a significant proportion of Medianizer updates relative to spread. A generous reduction of Oracle costs can be achieved by extending the expiration time from 15,500 seconds to 24 hours. If passed this proposal will set the default Oracle expiration time in the Relayer configuration to 24 hours (86,400 seconds).*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, June 2.
* The [Oracles Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#oracles-ora-001-) will implement changes, as outlined in [MIP10 - Oracle Management](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP10).

**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**
