* Minimum Vault Collateralization Ratio: **100%**.
* Liquidation Process: MIP21. 

*Note MIP21 is the name of the smart contracts used in liquidation of RWA collaterals, as well as the name of a now offboarded MIP*.

Please review the following forum threads containing information about Coinbase Custody (RWA014) to inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Coinbase Custody (RWA014) will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit and dewiz's schedules allows.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
