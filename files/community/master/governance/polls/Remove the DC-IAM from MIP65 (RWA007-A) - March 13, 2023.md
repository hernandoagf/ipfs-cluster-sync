# Poll: Remove the DC-IAM from MIP65 (RWA007-A) - March 13, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Remove the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) from MIP65 (RWA007-A).

This would mean that the full debt ceiling of the RWA007-A could be deployed, rather than being throttled by the Target Available Debt parameter.

More information on the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module may be found on the Maker Operational Manual [here](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/request-to-poll-increase-debt-ceiling-for-mip65-by-750m-to-1-250m/20119) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
