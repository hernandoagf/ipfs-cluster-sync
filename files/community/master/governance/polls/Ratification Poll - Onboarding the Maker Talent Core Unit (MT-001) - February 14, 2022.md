### MIP39c2-SP28: Adding Maker Talent Core Unit (MT-001)

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP39c2-SP28 adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent. Through the establishment of the Maker Talent Core Unit as a center of expertise, MakerDAO will get a competitive advantage in terms of attracting and retaining crypto talent, given the outstanding hiring/work experience they will be able to provide to their core contributors. At the same time, the Maker Talent CU will be able to make assessments and audit reports about the Core Units’ best practices in the area of people management.*

### MIP40c3-SP50: Modify Core Unit Budget - Maker Talent (MT-001)

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP40c3-SP50 adds the DAI budget for the Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent.*  

*The Maker Talent CU will act as a center of expertise, empowering CUs to autonomously attract and retain core contributors in the most efficient manner.*

*The Maker Talent CU costing model is designed with the following goals in mind:*

*The Maker Talent CU is to cover the infrastructure-related (sourcing channels, recruitment marketing, infrastructure) and operational-related costs (Compensation TalentCU contributors, daily operations). 2023 onwards the CUs may be charged a service fee to support the Maker TalentCU’s infrastructure and operational costs.*

*The Maker Talent CU is to maintain a reasonable buffer for unexpected expenses.*

*Whereas the Maker Talent CU is covering all fixed costs, the CUs themselves will cover the variable costs (e.g., referral rewards, agency fees, event-related costs, assessment costs) if they choose to make use of any of these options.*
