# Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) - June 13, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, June 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* Abstain - should be the only option ranked if you have no preference on the outcome of this poll.
* Approve Task Force and associated delegated authority to spend funds - ranking this option supports the approval of the Growth Task Force and initial funding of 1 million DAI.
* Approve Task Force without associated delegated authority to spend funds - ranking this option supports the approval of the Growth Task Force with no initial funding. This would allow the task force access to the expedited governance process described in [MIP75](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP75).
* Reject Task Force - ranking this option supports the rejection of the Growth Task Force, granting no special privileges or funding. 


A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*It is our view that we are in a nascent stage of crypto, and controlling as much future market share as possible is critical for the survival of this project. Our focus is on practical solutions to achieve the objectives listed below as quickly as possible. Perfection is the enemy of progress. We aim to find solutions that work first and backfill decentralization / resilience later.*
