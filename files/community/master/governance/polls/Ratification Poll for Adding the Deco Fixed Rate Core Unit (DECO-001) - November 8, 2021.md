### MIP40c3-SP35

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*The Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit is requesting a Budget for the fixed period of December 1, 2021, through December 1, 2024, (36 Months), with a fixed budget floor of 1,862,500 Dai annually, paid monthly secured in advance quarterly. Deco is not requesting, nor has it included any upfront reimbursement of costs for past work.
