# Poll: SparkLend Gnosis Chain - Increase wstETH Supply Cap to 10,000 wstETH - November 6, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Scope Facilitator. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 6 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

With MakerDAO Governance heading into a one-month break, Phoenix Labs is proposing the following adjustments to the SparkLend Gnosis Chain wstETH supply cap so that the protocol can grow without intervention during the holiday break. Express your support or opposition to the following proposed change:

- Increase wstETH supply cap from 5,000 to **10,000 wstETH**.

For more information about this proposed change, please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-to-adjust-sparklend-parameters/22542) and [BA Labs' risk analysis](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-parameter-change-gnosis-chain-wsteth-supply-cap/22553).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

* Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell implementing the wstETH supply cap increase on SparkLend Gnosis Chain.
* An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
