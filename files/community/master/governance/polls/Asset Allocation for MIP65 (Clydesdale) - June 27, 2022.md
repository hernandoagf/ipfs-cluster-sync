# Poll: Asset Allocation for MIP65 (Clydesdale) - June 27, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 27 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* **US Short Treasuries (100%)** - 100% composition of US Short-Term Treasuries, 40% 0-1 year US Treasury ishares ETF & 60% 1-3 year US Treasury ishares ETF [from BlackRock](https://hackmd.io/@allangiraf/Clydesdale-BRproposal).
* **US Short Treasuries (80%) + IG Corp Bond(20%)** - 80% composition of US Short-Term Treasuries (40% 0-1 year US Treasury ishares ETF & 60% 1-3 year US Treasury ishares ETF [from BlackRock](https://hackmd.io/@allangiraf/Clydesdale-BRproposal)) and 20% IG Corporate Bond (split of US Treasury Index and Active global mandate for 0-5y investment grade, clean money aligned, corporate bonds [from Baillie Gifford](https://hackmd.io/@allangiraf/Clydesdale-BG-proposal)).

This allocation poll is a result of the passage of [MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP65). It may be helpful to review this MIP before voting.
