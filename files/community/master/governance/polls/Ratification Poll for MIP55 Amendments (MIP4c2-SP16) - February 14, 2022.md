This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, February 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP16 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This amendment for MIP55: Special Purpose Fund aims to improve the clarity of the original MIP text, allowing a clear distinction between which MIP55c3 subproposal may enter the Weekly Cycle and which has to enter the Monthly Governance Cycle, their respective Feedback and Frozen Periods, and giving much needed clarification for proposals of exactly 50k DAI. This amendment also brings some minor typo fixes to MIP55c1 and MIP55c2.*
