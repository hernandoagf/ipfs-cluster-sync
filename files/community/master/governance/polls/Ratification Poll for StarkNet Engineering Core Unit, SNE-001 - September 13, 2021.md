### Facilitator Onboarding, SNE-001

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*I have a genuine interest and respect for the Maker protocol and deFi in general. The decentralization of the financial system is a topic I have been passionate about since 2009. In 2011 I wrote two masterâ€™s theses on the subprimes crisis and the lack of transparency in transactions and packaging of structured debt products. I am (strangely) passionate about risk management and debt products. I started my career doing valuation of high yield debt portfolios in traditional finance, then built debt models for project finance, then built a risk management company for crypto assets, then built a lending product with a crypto custodian.*
