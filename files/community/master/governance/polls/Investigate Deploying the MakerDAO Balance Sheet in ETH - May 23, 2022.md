# Poll: Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH - May 23, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning Monday, May 23 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state). 


Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-deploy-the-balance-sheet-in-eth/14834), including the [Towards taking asset risk](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/towards-taking-asset-risks-a-primer/14265) and [A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-balance-sheet-approach-to-executing-an-aggressive-growth-strategy-the-road-to-300m-revenues/14818) posts, to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following action will be taken:**
* The relevant Core Units will investigate options for deploying a portion of the MakerDAO balance sheet in ETH.
* Future on-chain polls will ask the community to support specific proposals.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
