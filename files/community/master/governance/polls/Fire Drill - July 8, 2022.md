# Poll: Fire Drill - July 8, 2022

Something's not right! There's not supposed to be a poll here... Check out the MakerDAO Discord and Forum to make sure someone has been notified about this irregularity. 

In a real emergency, the protocol's success could be dependent on how quickly we can mobilize. Make sure you are clear this is a drill, but go make sure others are responding to this evolving situation!

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Security Stakeholder Alignment Initiative. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for two days beginning on Friday, July 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This is a drill to test MKR Voter response time. Please vote in this poll to indicate you would have been able to assist the protocol in an urgent/emergency situation.

Since you're already submitting a vote why not give us a little info. Please submit your vote for yes, no, or abstain to participate in this drill.

* Vote `Yes` if you believe these "fire drills" are a valuable use of resources.
* Vote `No` if you do not think these "fire drills" are not a valuable use of resources.
* Vote `Abstain` if you are not sure or do not wish to give an opinion on the value of these drills.

This discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/fire-drill-request-for-discussion-informal-polls/13799) will give you more information on the motivation behind this drill. A thread will be posted in response to this fire drill once this exercise has been noticed by the community.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the vote breakdown, the following will take place after this poll:**
* Members of the Security Stakeholder Alignment Initiative will break down the results of this fire drill.
* Response times and effectiveness of the test will be cataloged. 
* Any feedback provided in Discord or the Forum will be considered if/when the next drill occurs.
