# Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4)

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, June 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP55c3-SP4 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*The Maker Protocol holds over $5.4B in stablecoins earning zero yield. There are multiple efforts underway ([short-term bonds](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip13c3-sp12-declaration-of-intent-invest-in-short-term-bonds/13084), [IVs](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-growth-strategy-we-must-act-now/14501), [RWA](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-growth-strategy-we-must-act-now/14501), [Multi-chain](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-growth-strategy-we-must-act-now/14501)) to invest the majority of stablecoin exposure into growth opportunities. Our aim is to begin experimenting with generating yield on balance sheet assets and support DAI liquidity/utility, creating a new revenue stream for the protocol. As DeFi is evolving quickly, we should continue researching, investigating, and experimenting with DeFi-native yield-generation strategies.*
