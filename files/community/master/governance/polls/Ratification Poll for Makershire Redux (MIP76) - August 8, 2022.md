# Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, August 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP76 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*"The Maker Protocol holds approximately $5.2B in stablecoins effectively earning zero yield. There are multiple efforts underway (off-chain and on-chain short-term bonds) to invest the majority of stablecoin exposure. Our aim is to begin generating yield on balance sheet assets and support DAI liquidity/utility, creating a new revenue stream for the protocol."*
