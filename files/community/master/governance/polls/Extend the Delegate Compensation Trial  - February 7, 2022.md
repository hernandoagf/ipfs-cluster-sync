# Poll: Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial  - February 7, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* Extend the [Delegate Compensation Trial](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-trial-delegate-compensation-as-described-in-mip61-over-3-months/10978) by a maximum of 6 months, until the end of July 2022.
* Allow the Delegate Compensation Trial to conclude before July 2022 if [MIP61 - Recognized Delegate Compensation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61) is approved.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-extend-the-delegate-compensation-trial/12686) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Delegate Compensation Trial will be extended until either the end of July 2022 or until the approval of [MIP61 - Recognized Delegate Compensation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61), whichever comes first.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
