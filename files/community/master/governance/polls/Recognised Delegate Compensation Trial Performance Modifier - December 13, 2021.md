# Poll: Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier - December 13, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO governance community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to a performance modifier to determine compensation in the delegate compensation trial. Recognised Delegates are currently compensated only if both their voting and communication metrics are 90% or higher. The compensation method for this trial can be found in [MIP61](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip61-delegate-compensation/10640). If successful, this proposal will make the following changes for the duration of the trial, or until voted otherwise.
- Delegate compensation will continue to be calculated per the formula detailed in MIP61, with a Performance Modifier applied to the eligible amount, based on the Recognised Delegate's lowest scoring metric.
- Recognised Delegates with both metrics at or above 75% will become eligible for compensation. If either metric is below 75%, the Recognised Delegate will receive no compensation.
- There will be a linearly scaled Performance Modifier applied to the eligible amount when the lowest scoring metric is between 75% and 90%. When the lowest scoring metric is 75%, compensation will be modified to 40% of the eligible amount and when the lowest scoring metric is 90% or greater, compensation will be 100% of the eligible amount.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-introduce-a-performance-modifier-to-the-delegate-compensation-trial/11850) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Payments to qualifying delegates will be modified starting in December, distributed via executive vote at the end of each month.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
