# Ratification Poll for Phoenix Labs - Spark Lend Launch (SPF) (MIP55c3-SP16) - March 13, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, March 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP55c3-SP16 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This SPF provides funding for the launch of Spark Lend, the first Spark product we want to help launch from Phoenix Labs.*

*Spark Lend will bring to Maker a new decentralized application that will integrate with Makerâ€™s strategic services (D3M, PSM, and DSR) into one front end to attract more crypto users and help to bootstrap the creation of the SubDAO communities. As presented in our roadmap, we want to start with a simple front-end that will allow the Maker Community to evaluate the growth of the product and according to it and based on the Community feedback, we could launch new features and products in the future.*

*If [MIP55c3-SP15](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip55c3-sp15-phoenix-labs-initial-funding-spf/19733), [MIP116: D3M to Spark Lend](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip116-d3m-to-spark-lend/19732), and this SPF are approved, we will be ready to launch Spark Lend by April 2023 and maintain it for up to one year.*

*All products created by Phoenix Labs will belong to MakerDAO, including the smart contracts, the Front End, and all intellectual property.*
