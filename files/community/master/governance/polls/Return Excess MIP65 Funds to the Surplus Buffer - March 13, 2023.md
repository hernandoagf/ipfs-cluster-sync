# Poll: Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer - March 13, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Strategic Finance Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**

## Review
