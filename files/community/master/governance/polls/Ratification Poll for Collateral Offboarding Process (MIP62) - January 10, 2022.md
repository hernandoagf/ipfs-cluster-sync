# Ratification Poll for Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62) - January 10, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 10 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP62 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. This has created a poor user experience when vault owners are unaware of a collateral offboarding, and this MIP is designed to reduce the likelihood of a user being surprised by a liquidation due to offboarding.*

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, January 27. 
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).

**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**
