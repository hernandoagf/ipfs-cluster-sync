# Poll: Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT - June 13, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* Incentivize the DAI<>USDC and DAI<>OP pairs on Velodrome.
* Send the resulting trading fees to the MakerDAO Optimism Governance Address.

[For context](https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1529549901239050240), MakerDAO will be receiving an airdrop totaling ~1% of voting power to direct emissions on Velodrome.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-incoming-velodrome-airdrop-on-optimism-velo-venft/15371) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Velodrome team will be directed to this vote and manage the initial Maker voting weight accordingly.
* The management of voting and fees will be turned over to the Pause Proxy at a future date, requiring further changes and fee collecting to be administered by an Executive Vote. 
* A Maker Governance contract extension will be deployed on Optimism via an Executive Vote, subject to the Protocol Engineering team's schedule. 
* If these Executive Votes pass, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
