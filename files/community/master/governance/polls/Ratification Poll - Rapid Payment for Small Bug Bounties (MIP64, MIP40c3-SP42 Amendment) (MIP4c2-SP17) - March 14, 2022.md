# Ratification Poll for Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) (MIP4c2-SP17) - March 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, March 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP17 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*The current bug bounty payment process is adequate for large payouts, but inconvenient for small payouts. This MIP adds a small payout process.*

- *Small payouts can be made without delay from the Core Unit’s operational wallet. No need for bounty hunters to wait for a monthly executive spell.*
- *IS-001 Core Unit decides which payment process to use.*

*This amendment would increase the CU’s budget by 100 000 * 115% = 115 000 DAI per month.*

*In addition, there are some minor corrections:*

- *Add a budget line item for gas fees*
- *Round up the Facilitator’s compensation to a round number of USD (no cents)*
