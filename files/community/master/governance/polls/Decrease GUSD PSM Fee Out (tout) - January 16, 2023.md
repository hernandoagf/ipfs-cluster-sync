# Poll: Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) - January 16, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [Strategic Finance Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP36). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 16 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Decrease the PSM-GUSD-A [Fee Out `tout`](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-psm#fee-out-tout)from 0.1% to **0.0%**

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/request-to-poll-psm-gusd-a-parameters/19416) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
