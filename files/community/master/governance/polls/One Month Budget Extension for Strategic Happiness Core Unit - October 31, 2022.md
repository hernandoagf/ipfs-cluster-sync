# Poll: One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit - October 31, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 31 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Transfer **49,999.99 DAI** to [strategichappiness.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x955993df48b0458a01cfb5fd7df5f5dca6443550).
* Transfer **5.21 MKR** to [strategichappiness.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x955993df48b0458a01cfb5fd7df5f5dca6443550).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-the-shcu-requests-a-moment-of-your-time/18466) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
