## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit, CES-001 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

### Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit - Mandate

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Scaling Dai and decentralized collateral management are the biggest motivators for the Collateral Engineering Services (CES) Core Unit. The Maker protocol and community has an understanding and strong consensus that collateral is our top priority. We have done a great job since the Multi-collateral Dai launch in November 2019. Since then and using the resources available to us, we have designed and iterated on a collateral onboarding process that has served us well. Now, it is time to greatly improve upon our capabilities to reach one trillion Dai and beyond.*

### Add Core Unit Budget, CES-001

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Building upon the theme of sustainability of the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES), the budget reflects support of the Mandates and business continuity in MIP39. Any elements of this budget reflecting a likeness to other Core Units is a principle of building on the shoulders of giants. Much appreciation is given to all the trailblazers.*
*The CES budget is designed with the following in mind:*

* *Paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit*
* *Building a reserve for sustainability*

### Facilitator Onboarding, CES-001

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*My role is to support the Mandates and business continuity for the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES).*

*Today, this is best accomplished by taking the role of Facilitator, Team Lead, and Business Leader. My background and experience with the Maker Foundation makes me uniquely qualified to assume these roles. As the Core Unit establishes itself, I will look to transition the Facilitator role, or a portion of that responsibility, to a bonafide member of the MakerDAO community.*
