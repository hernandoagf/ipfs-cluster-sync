# Growth AVC
Name: Growth AVC

**What is Growth AVC? Growth AVC is a…**

1. **Dovish AVC**, focusing on expansion, experimentation, and growth.

2. **Research focused AVC,** meaning we will encourage research and analysis regarding proposals to help make informed decisions. This is also to prevent Growth AVC from abused as a freely handing precious funding to poorly planned initiatives

3. **Active AVC**, not only frequent meetings but we will look at different scopes and see how they can be improved actively.

**Growth AVC Culture**

1. **Anon / Time zone friendly.** We will have a public AVC text place (whether that’s forum or email or others that are compliant) where CDs or others who want to share their suggestions and voice their opinions can send in to count as participation.

2. **Can be critical but be respectful.** Just because we are in a AVC doesn’t mean Growth AVC should not tolerate any criticism. However, as a governance participant in Maker, all should be respected and foul plays (like explicit insults) won’t be received well.

3. **A Safe Harbor.** While the banning rule from AVC to CD is not yet crystal clear, we will not ban CDs unless they acted in an unconstitutional way deemed by both AVC and facilitators. In addition, any CDs that were banned by other AVCs for “preference” rather than breaking the constitution will have a chance in Growth AVC.

## Delegate Statement

As a Constitutional Delegate, Frontier Research sees its core role as helping translate the vision and philosophy of AVC members into practical Maker governance decisions and reforms. We think we are well placed to assist with this given our prior experience with Maker governance and constitutional reforms in DeFi and beyond.

We intend to distinguish ourselves with high-quality analysis and recommendations for our chosen AVCs, Growth and ReFi. Consistency also matters: our prior delegate platform scored 100% for both participation and communication, and we never missed a vote. We are looking forward to supporting MKR holders and AVCs through the Endgame, hopefully ushering in an exciting new era for Maker.
