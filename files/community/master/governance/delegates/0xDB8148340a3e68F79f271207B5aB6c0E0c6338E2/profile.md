# Growth CVC
Name: Growth CVC

**What is Growth CVC? Growth CVC is a…**

1. **Dovish CVC**, focusing on expansion, experimentation, and growth.

2. **Research focused CVC,** meaning we will encourage research and analysis regarding proposals to help make informed decisions. This is also to prevent Growth CVC from abused as a freely handing precious funding to poorly planned initiatives

3. **Active CVC**, not only frequent meetings but we will look at different scopes and see how they can be improved actively.

**Growth CVC Culture**

1. **Anon / Time zone friendly.** We will have a public CVC text place (whether that’s forum or email or others that are compliant) where CDs or others who want to share their suggestions and voice their opinions can send in to count as participation.

2. **Can be critical but be respectful.** Just because we are in a CVC doesn’t mean Growth CVC should not tolerate any criticism. However, as a governance participant in Maker, all should be respected and foul plays (like explicit insults) won’t be received well.

3. **A Safe Harbor.** While the banning rule from CVC to CD is not yet crystal clear, we will not ban CDs unless they acted in an unconstitutional way deemed by both CVC and facilitators. In addition, any CDs that were banned by other CVCs for “preference” rather than breaking the constitution will have a chance in Growth CVC.

## Delegate Statement

As a Constitutional Delegate, Frontier Research sees its core role as helping translate the vision and philosophy of CVC members into practical Maker governance decisions and reforms. We think we are well placed to assist with this given our prior experience with Maker governance and constitutional reforms in DeFi and beyond.

We intend to distinguish ourselves with high-quality analysis and recommendations for our chosen CVCs, Growth and ReFi. Consistency also matters: our prior delegate platform scored 100% for both participation and communication, and we never missed a vote. We are looking forward to supporting MKR holders and CVCs through the Endgame, hopefully ushering in an exciting new era for Maker.
