# Regenerative Finance AVC

The Regenerative Finance AVC protects the Public Good purpose of MakerDAO as ratified in the Maker Constitution. Our priority is to advance the role of DAI as an “Unbiased World Currency” that supports “The Regeneration” as may be interpreted through the 8 Principles of a Regenerative Economy published by the Capital Institute (available for reference at [capitalinstitute.org](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/)).
