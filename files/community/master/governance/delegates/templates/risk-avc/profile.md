# Risk AVC

RISK AVC is a strong supporter of the EndGame and believes that the objectives prescribed to deliver true decentralisation to MAKER.

The primary CORE values to be upheld by RISK AVC will be of course RISK, followed up by RESILIENCE.

Based on our experiences as a Recognised Delegate, the decision making process was based on a risk perspective. A similar process and perspective will be adopted by this AVC. The intention is to contribute to the 12 scopes as much as possible.

During the course of setting up the AVC, much time was taken to reach out to other academics (who prefers to remain anonymous) to collaborate on this journey to form the RISK AVC for Maker.

RISK AVC hopes to attract like minded individuals or parties to join us in our committee.

In order to initiate the AVC, 1.007 MKR has and will be kept in the wallet in accordance with MIP113 (4.2.1.1).

**Focus:**

Derisk MAKER by means of:

* Process assessment and risk mitigation
* Asset collateral diversification
* Real World Assets strategy risk vs rewards

**Our Strategic Stance:**

* Protocol Growth - Hawkish
  * Trailblazing new ideas into unventured territory.
* Implementation - Dovish
  * Growth with caution to ascertain that the risk taken is within allowable tolerances.
