It **_must_** remain stable, decentralised, open to everybody and uncensorable.\n\n2. People with stake in the game are DAI holders and MKR holders. DAI holders rely on the key characteristics of DAI listed above. MKR holders have invested their own money in the project and ***must*** to be rewarded. The reward is, of course, primarily financial (value appreciation of MKR) but can also come in other forms: sense of stability and trust in the protocol, 'status' (if MakerDAO becomes trendy), sense of fulfillment if MakerDAO contributes to some good causes, etc. \n\nThese are the objectives, and only these. \n\nThis does not mean that, for example, MakerDAO should not be active in some form of charity. To the contrary this could provide positive rewards to MKR-holders as hinted above. But each decision/activity/endeavour **must** always be able to clearly answer to the question: \"*How does it contribute to objectives 1 and 2?*\". A scientific approach should always be used to determine the likelihood of success of any given proposal.\n\n**How to achieve the goals?**\n1) Embrace complexity. \n\"There is always a simple solution to any problem, and that is often the wrong one.\" \nThis means that MakerDAO is a VERY complex project, and cannot be dumbed down to a simple receipt for success. This is clearly witnessed by the fact that despite all, all other \"decentralised stablecoins\" emerged so far, are either orders of magnitude smaller that DAI or are basically just scams.\n2) Pretend simplicity.\nAlso the construction and deployment of a stellar probe, like the Voyager program, is an extremely complex endeavour. This however does not mean that it cannot be explained to people, at different levels of understanding and details, in a way that positively impact everybody. In particular, the Voyager program has been _successfully managed and directed_ (also) by people without a PhD in physics.   \n3) Keep it simple stupid! (KISS)\nSimple yet effective structures can be used to understand and manage extremely complex projects. Keeping structures simple and transparent and avoiding the (often natural) \"complexity explosion\" is not easy. It needs constant attention and work. \n\nThe KISS AVC will use its influence and power to achieve Goals 1&2 by means of the KISS approach: embrace complexity, pretend simplicity, and maintain simple structures. \n\nThe two Goals 1&2 are clear. Everything that has a scientifically proven likelihood of achieving these goals, within the given amount of resources, will be supported. All the rest will be rejected as \"out of focus for now\". \n\n**Where do we sit in the Dove/Hawk spectrum?**\n\nThe ENDGAME plan proposed by Rune is compatible with the KISS principle when it requires AVCs to be broadly classified in two categories: Doves or Hawks. \n\nOf course, a binary description of this type does not capture the immense variety of viewpoints of all AVCs, not to mention of the MKR-holders within a given AVC.

Allowing us to guarantee optimal security, thus transmitting greater security for DAI holders, partners, and participants in the protocol.\n\n**Ethos and commitment**: We will actively contribute to the spread of DAI to all corners of Latin America and the world. Our ethos is aligned with the values of MakerDAO, and therefore our commitment goes beyond mere participation in governance.\n\n**This CVC supports the vision and roadmap outlined in the Endgame towards decentralization.** We firmly believe that decentralization is a requirement that will define the success or failure of the protocol in the long term.\n\nAs an organization committed to the principles of decentralization, autonomy, and self-governance, we believe **that supporting public goods is a crucial component of creating a sustainable and inclusive financial ecosystem**. In this regard, we commit to preparing educational content that promotes MakerDAO and easily explains to MKR holders how to participate and involve in governance.\n\nRegarding the dovish v hawkish dilemma, we prefer to go with a balanced strategy for MakerDAO that would aim to maintain stability while also promoting growth and innovation. By finding the right balance between these two objectives, MakerDAO could build a sustainable and successful platform that attracts new users and drives innovation in the decentralized finance space.\n\n# Penguin Soldier\nDelegate Address: 0x0b2851332e4c7083d2148acfb56e567a236dbbc2\nForum: @Penguin.Soldier",

And we believe that MakerDAO should position itself and lead the growing financial revolution that enables autonomy, independence, and self-governance.\n\nThis voter committee’s central values will be:\n\n**Growth and Adoption**: We will drive and support all initiatives that allow for massive growth and adoption of DAI while reducing risks associated with the protocol, particularly assets that could compromise its economic stability.\n\n**Long-term Sustainability and Revenue**: We will support and promote all initiatives and proposals that develop reliable, secure, and revenue-stable products for the protocol.\n\n**Security and reliability**: We will also be alert to potential points of excessive centralization that could affect the protocol. Allowing us to guarantee optimal security, thus transmitting greater security for DAI holders, partners, and participants in the protocol.\n\n**Ethos and commitment**: We will actively contribute to the spread of DAI to all corners of Latin America and the world. Our ethos is aligned with the values of MakerDAO, and therefore our commitment goes beyond mere participation in governance.\n\n**This CVC supports the vision and roadmap outlined in the Endgame towards decentralization.** We firmly believe that decentralization is a requirement that will define the success or failure of the protocol in the long term.\n\nAs an organization committed to the principles of decentralization, autonomy, and self-governance, we believe **that supporting public goods is a crucial component of creating a sustainable and inclusive financial ecosystem**. In this regard, we commit to preparing educational content that promotes MakerDAO and easily explains to MKR holders how to participate and involve in governance.\n\nRegarding the dovish v hawkish dilemma, we prefer to go with a balanced strategy for MakerDAO that would aim to maintain stability while also promoting growth and innovation. By finding the right balance between these two objectives, MakerDAO could build a sustainable and successful platform that attracts new users and drives innovation in the decentralized finance space.\n\n# Cloaky\nDelegate Address: 0x86f8a04fbaf5c8ed0465624c355c1e3c073213ca\nForum: @cloaky",
