# Regenerative Finance CVC
Name: Regenerative Finance CVC

The Regenerative Finance CVC protects the Public Good purpose of MakerDAO as ratified in the Maker Constitution. Our priority is to advance the role of DAI as an “Unbiased World Currency” that supports “The Regeneration” as may be interpreted through the 8 Principles of a Regenerative Economy published by the Capital Institute (available for reference at [capitalinstitute.org](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/)).

## Delegate Statement

As a Constitutional Delegate, Frontier Research sees its core role as helping translate the vision and philosophy of CVC members into practical Maker governance decisions and reforms. We think we are well placed to assist with this given our prior experience with Maker governance and constitutional reforms in DeFi and beyond.

We intend to distinguish ourselves with high-quality analysis and recommendations for our chosen CVCs, Growth and ReFi. Consistency also matters: our prior delegate platform scored 100% for both participation and communication, and we never missed a vote. We are looking forward to supporting MKR holders and CVCs through the Endgame, hopefully ushering in an exciting new era for Maker.
