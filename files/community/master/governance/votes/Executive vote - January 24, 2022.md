## Executive Summary

This is an [out-of-schedule](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41#MIP41c2) executive proposal. It has been deployed and added to the voting portal in response to the large wave of surplus (flap) auctions triggered by liquidations at the end of last week and the following [urgent](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24#MIP24c4) [signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/urgent-signal-request-stop-mkr-burning/12806). 

The express purpose of this proposal is to prevent surplus (flap) auctions temporarily until the auction/burn mechanism can be improved.

If this executive proposal passes, the following **changes** will occur within the Maker Protocol:
* The existing [System Surplus Buffer](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-system-surplus-buffer) lerp function will be disabled.
* The [System Surplus Buffer](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-system-surplus-buffer) parameter will be set to 250 million DAI.

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR in support of the changes and additions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay). This means that if this executive proposal passes, the changes and additions listed above will only become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired. The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **48 hours**.

If this executive proposal does not pass within 30 days, then it will expire and can no longer have any effect on the Maker Protocol.
