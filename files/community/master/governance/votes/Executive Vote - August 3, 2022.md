As per this successful governance [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQMDasC#vote-breakdown), 25 million DAI will be drawn down in the RWA-009 (HVBank) vault, if this executive proposal passes.

Further description of the schedule and mechanism being used for drawdown from this vault can be seen in this [post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa009-hvbank-mip21-token-ces-domain-team-assessment/15861/8) from the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES-001).

### Keep3r Network Stream Re-deployment

As per this forum [post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip63c4-sp4-onboard-amend-keeper-network-keep3r-network/14321/8) the previously established stream to Keep3r Network will be cancelled and a new stream deployed, if this executive proposal passes.

As per the ratified [MIP63c4-SP4: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP63c4SP4), a total of 215,000 DAI will be streamed to Keep3r Keeper Network if this executive proposal passes:

- **215,000 DAI** will be streamed to the Keep3r Keeper Network at [0x37b375e3D418fbECba6b283e704F840AB32f3b3C](https://etherscan.io/address/0x37b375e3D418fbECba6b283e704F840AB32f3b3C) starting on 2022-07-01 and ending on 2023-01-31 at a rate of 1,000 DAI/day.
