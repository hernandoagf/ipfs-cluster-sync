### Revoking Content Production DAI Budget
As a result of this successful [budget proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP49), the [Content Production Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP5) budget will be revoked if this executive proposal passes. Note that when a token stream is revoked, it will prevent new tokens from accruing to the recipient, but will still allow the recipient access to tokens that have already accrued.

### Replacing the Real World Finance DAI Budget Stream
Given that the facilitator for the [Real World Finance Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP1) has changed, we received a request from the [new facilitator](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41c4SP27) to adjust the implementation of the existing Real World Finance DAI budget stream. This request is detailed [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwf-001-auditor-flow/12900). Given that this is an administrative change and budget amounts remain the same, we elected to include it in this executive proposal. If this executive proposal passes the following will occur.
* The existing Real World Finance DAI budget stream will be revoked.
* A replacement stream will be setup, streaming **1,705,000 DAI** to 0x96d7b01Cc25B141520C717fa369844d34FF116ec starting at 2022-02-01 and ending at 2022-12-31.

### Protocol Engineering Housekeeping
The on-chain changelog, also known as the [chainlog](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/) will be updated to include the `CLIP_FAB` contract if this executive proposal passes. This proposed change is part of ongoing Protocol Engineering housekeeping efforts and will not have any direct effect on the Maker Protocol.
