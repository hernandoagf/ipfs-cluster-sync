## Proposal Details

### DAI Foundation DAI Budget Streams

As per this [governance poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQJ9hYq#poll-detail) ratifying the bear market option from the latest [budget proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP74) from the [DAI Foundation Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP17) (DAIF-001), the following three DAI streams will be created, if this executive proposal passes:

- **67,863 DAI** will be streamed to [0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63](https://etherscan.io/address/0x34d8d61050ef9d2b48ab00e6dc8a8ca6581c5d63), starting on 2022-10-01 and ending on 2022-10-31.
- **329,192 DAI** will be streamed to [0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63](https://etherscan.io/address/0x34d8d61050ef9d2b48ab00e6dc8a8ca6581c5d63), starting on 2022-11-01 and ending on 2023-08-31.
- **270,000 DAI** will be streamed to [0x5F5c328732c9E52DfCb81067b8bA56459b33921f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f5c328732c9e52dfcb81067b8ba56459b33921f), starting on 2022-10-01 and ending on 2022-12-31.

### Oracles Core Unit DAI Budget Stream

As per this [governance poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qma3P8v9) ratifying the latest [budget proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP75) from the [Oracles Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP75) (ORA-001), the following DAI stream will be created, if this executive proposal passes:

- **2,337,804 DAI** will be streamed to [0x2d09B7b95f3F312ba6dDfB77bA6971786c5b50Cf](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d09b7b95f3f312ba6ddfb77ba6971786c5b50cf), starting on 2022-07-01 and ending on 2023-06-30.

**Note:** the approved budget was for 4,554,575 DAI, but the previous year's budget stream still contains an unclaimed amount of 2,216,771 DAI. Following discussion with the ORA-001 facilitator @Nik, it was agreed that the new stream would be set up containing the difference between the approved budget, and the DAI remaining in the previous DAI budget stream. The Oracles Core Unit will therefore still have access to the full DAI amount approved by Maker Governance. A further 733,547.93 DAI was [returned](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x379fa62decb0b6fb503c75d0dde96c2088956b2a71bd8a2e0652e28af8007431) to the Surplus Buffer.

- **50,000 DAI** will be transferred to [0x173d85CD1754daD73cfc673944D9C8BF11A01D3F](https://etherscan.io/address/0x173d85cd1754dad73cfc673944d9c8bf11a01d3f) as per [MIP55c3-SP6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP55c3SP6).
- **30,000 DAI** will be transferred to [0x29408abeCe474C85a12ce15B05efBB6A1e8587fe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29408abece474c85a12ce15b05efbb6a1e8587fe) as per [MIP55c3-SP8](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP55c3SP8).

### MKR Stream Cleanup

This action is for accounting purposes only and will not affect the balance of MKR in the Pause Proxy.
