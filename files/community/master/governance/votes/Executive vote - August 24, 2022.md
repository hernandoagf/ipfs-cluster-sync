## Executive Summary

If this executive proposal passes, the following **changes** will occur within the Maker Protocol:
- 25 million DAI will be drawn down in the RWA-009 (HVBank) vault, as detailed below.

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR in support of the changes and additions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay).

The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **48 hours**.

This executive proposal includes an office-hours modifier that means that it **can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday**. This is to ensure that Genesis can process the DAI during business hours.  

If this executive proposal does not pass within 30 days, then it will expire and can no longer have any effect on the Maker Protocol.
