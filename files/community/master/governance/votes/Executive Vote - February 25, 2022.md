### MakerMan Retroactive Compensation for November 2021

As per this [governance poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmR2DX4L), a one-off retroactive payment will be made to MakerMan as a result of changes to the ongoing Delegate Compensation Trial, detailed below, if this executive proposal passes.

* **8,245 DAI** transferred to [MakerMan](https://vote.makerdao.com/address/0x22d5294a23d49294bf11d9db8beda36e104ad9b3) at [0x9AC6A6B24bCd789Fa59A175c0514f33255e1e6D0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9AC6A6B24bCd789Fa59A175c0514f33255e1e6D0).

This payment covers work done as a Recognized Delegate during the month of November 2021 which did not qualify for compensation at the time, but after changes to the Delegate Compensation Trial, would now qualify for compensation.
