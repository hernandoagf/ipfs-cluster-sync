## Proposal Details

### Spark Protocol-Aave Revenue Share Payment

*Authorization*: [Support Scope Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP106#9-4-1-spark-protocol-aave-revenue-share)\
*Proposal*: [Forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-aave-revenue-share-calculation-payment-1-q3-2023/22486) "Spark - Aave Revenue Share Calculation & Payment #1 [Q3 2023]"\
*Authorizing Party:* [Support Scope Facilitator](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-aave-revenue-share-calculation-payment-1-q3-2023/22486/2)

The proposed action concerns executing the first payment of the Spark Protocol-Aave Revenue Share Agreement. If this executive proposal passes, Maker Governance will execute a payment from the Surplus Buffer of **2889 DAI** to a smart contract ([0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)) controlled by Aave Governance.

### DAO Resolution for HV Bank (RWA009-A) Vault

*Authorization*: [Executive Vote 2023-09-13](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-stability-scope-parameter-changes-spark-protocol-d3m-parameter-changes-set-fortunafi-debt-ceiling-to-zero-dai-dao-resolution-for-hv-bank-delegate-compensation-and-other-actions-september-13-2023)\
*Proposal*: [Forum post](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/huntingdon-valley-bank-transaction-documents-on-permaweb/16264/17) "Huntingdon Valley Bank: Transaction Documents on Permaweb"\
*Authorizing Party:* [Stability Scope Facilitator](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/huntingdon-valley-bank-transaction-documents-on-permaweb/16264/18)

In a recent [Executive Vote](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-stability-scope-parameter-changes-spark-protocol-d3m-parameter-changes-set-fortunafi-debt-ceiling-to-zero-dai-dao-resolution-for-hv-bank-delegate-compensation-and-other-actions-september-13-2023), Maker Governance approved a DAO Resolution instructing the RWA Foundation to terminate future purchases in HV Bankâ€™s RWA Master Participation Trust and return excess available cash to the DAO. 

The proposed action concerns the approval of a new DAO Resolution that is a necessary precursor to the return of the excess cash to the DAO. It allows the RWA Foundation to onboard with Galaxy Digital Trading Cayman LLC, an exchange agent, through which the excess available cash will be returned. 

If this executive proposal passes, the DAO Resolution with the IPFS hash of [QmbrCPtpKsCaQ2pKc8qLnkL8TywRYcKHYaX6LEzhhKQqAw](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbrCPtpKsCaQ2pKc8qLnkL8TywRYcKHYaX6LEzhhKQqAw) will be approved. 

### Immunefi Security Core Unit MKR Vesting Transfer

*Authorization*: [Original ratified MKR budget proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP41)\
 *Proposal*: [Forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c3-sp13-removing-is-001/22392) "MIP39c3-SP13: Removing IS-001"

Per its voluntary offboarding proposal, Immunefi Security CU requests a payout of the MKR vested 2023-08-05, adjusted to 0.4 FTE. (See [manual repricing](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp41-immunefi-security-core-unit-mkr-budget-is-001/10814/3); FTE reduction in [July 2022](https://github.com/makerdao-is/transparency-reporting/blob/main/Monthly%20Budget%20Statements/2022-07.md#fte); adjusted MKR vesting schedule in [August 2022](https://github.com/makerdao-is/transparency-reporting/blob/main/Monthly%20Budget%20Statements/2022-08.md#3-mkr-vesting-overview); and final FTE reduction to 0.4 in [January 2023](https://github.com/makerdao-is/transparency-reporting/blob/main/Monthly%20Budget%20Statements/2023-01.md#fte).) 

If this executive proposal passes, a one-time MKR payment in the amount of **6.34 MKR** will be transferred to the Core Unit's Auditor Wallet ([0xd1F2eEf8576736C1EbA36920B957cd2aF07280F4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1F2eEf8576736C1EbA36920B957cd2aF07280F4)).

### Add GUSD and USDP Jar and SwapInputConduit Contracts to Chainlog

*Proposal*: [Forum Post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposed-housekeeping-item-upcoming-executive-spell-2023-11-01/22477) "Proposed Housekeeping Item (Upcoming Executive Spell - 2023-11-01)"\
*Authorizing Party*: [Protocol Scope Facilitator](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposed-housekeeping-item-upcoming-executive-spell-2023-11-01/22477/2)

In [December 2022](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/gusd-institutional-rewards-technical-solution-risk-assessment-and-deployment-details-for-receiving-payments-of-rewards/19055), a GUSD & MakerDAO partnership for institutional rewards was rolled out. In order for MakerDAO to receive the GUSD rewards, two contracts were deployed: the RwaSwapInputConduit2 and RwaJar. Recently, MakerDAO entered into a similar [partnership with Trident](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-usdp-psm-incentives-reth-initial-offboarding-rwa-vaults-reconfiguration-various-parameter-changes-avc-and-ad-compensation-facilitator-and-ecosystem-actor-compensation-spark-proxy-spell-october-11-2023) to receive USDP rewards. This deal also requires deploying the above-mentioned contracts.

If this executive proposal passes, these contracts will be added to the [Chainlog](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/) as:

- [`MCD_PSM_GUSD_A_JAR`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2E7a5B83525c3017383dEEd19Bb05Fe34a62C27)
- [`MCD_PSM_GUSD_A_INPUT_CONDUIT_JAR`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6934218d8B3E9ffCABEE8cd80F4c1C4167Afa638)
- [`MCD_PSM_PAX_A_JAR`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8bF8b5C58bb57Ee9C97D0FEA773eeE042B10a787)
- [`MCD_PSM_PAX_A_INPUT_CONDUIT_JAR`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDa276Ab5F1505965e0B6cD1B6da2A18CcBB29515)

Further, `<conduit>.rely(MCD_ESM)` will be called on the SwapInputConduit contracts to allow the ESM module to `deny` the pause proxy. In the event of a successful governance attack, this prevents funds from being stolen from the SwapInputConduit contracts.
