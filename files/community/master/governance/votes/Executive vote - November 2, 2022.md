## Proposal Details

### Offboarded Core Units - Cancelling DAI and MKR Streams

As per multiple successful offboarding proposals (linked below), three DAI and one MKR streams will be cancelled (`yank`ed) if this executive proposal passes. 

When a token stream is cancelled, it will prevent new tokens from accruing to the recipient, but will still allow the recipient access to tokens that have already accrued. An exception to this is when a stream has a cliff date, if the cliff date has not been reached, the recipient will not be able to access the tokens that have accrued.

* **DAI Stream #4** going to the [Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP32) will be cancelled as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP4).
* **DAI Stream #5** going to the [Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP11) will be cancelled as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP3).
* **DAI Stream #35** going to the [Real-World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP1) will be cancelled as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP5).
* **MKR Stream #23** going to the [Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP11) will be cancelled as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP3).

Please review [MIP39](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39) for details on offboarding Core Units, the forum thread discussing the [next steps](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/executive-vote-cu-offboarding-next-steps/18522), and the forum threads discussing the [offboarding of the Events Core Unit](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c3-sp4-offboarding-the-events-core-unit-events-001/17755), the [offboarding of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c3-sp3-offboarding-the-strategic-happiness-core-unit-sh-001/17754), and the [offboarding of the Real-World Finance Core Unit](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c3-sp5-offboarding-the-real-world-finance-core-unit-rwf-001/17753) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

### Offboarded Core Units - DAI Golden Parachute Budget Transfers

As per multiple successful offboarding proposals (linked below), a total of **210,998 DAI** and **169.5 MKR** will be transferred to multiple offboarded Core Units as part of their respective Golden Parachutes if this executive proposal passes.
* **167,666 DAI** will be transferred to the [Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP32) at [0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2) as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP4). This is less than the amount specified in the offboarding proposal as the Core Unit wallet contains unspent funds and will fund the difference. This has been agreed with the outgoing Core Unit Facilitator.
* **43,332 DAI** will be transferred to the [Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP11) at [0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d) as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP3).
