### MOMC Parameter Changes

As per this [governance poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmahDuNx) on the latest MakerDAO Open Market Committee [proposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-28-october-2022/18564), the following parameter changes will be made in the Maker Protocol if this executive proposal passes:

- **Increase** the MANA-A [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) from 4.5% to **7.5%**.
- **Decrease** the MANA-A [Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) from 17 million DAI to **10 million DAI**.

### Maker Teleport Technical Deployment on StarkNet
As per the outcome of successful Governance Polls [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbWkTvW) and [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmZxRgvG), [Maker Teleport (formerly known as Maker Wormhole)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introducing-maker-wormhole/11550) will be deployed on [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/), if this executive passes.

The StarkNet Maker Teleport parameters will be set as follows:
* The StarkNet Teleport Fee parameter will be set to **1 Basis Point**.
* The [Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-ceiling) will be set to **100,000 DAI**.

To facilitate this, the following change will also take place:
* The Maker Teleport Global Debt Ceiling will be increased by 100,000 DAI from 2 million DAI to **2,100,000 DAI**.

**Note:** to ensure security of the deployment this is below the 1 million DAI limit approved by Maker Governance, this limit can be raised later, if required.
