## Proposal Details

### RWA008-A Debt Ceiling Reduction

Following this [notification](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605/49) from the Societe Generale - Forge team that they have [burned](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3d88a16c53e89a74f2a35c2b2672c56bd612315d2553c44f401e3777ad8f66f2) their RWA008 token, we are setting the Debt Ceiling for this vault type to **0 DAI**, if this executive proposal passes. This is a housekeeping change to reflect the inability of this vault type to draw DAI. Further action may be required in the future to formally complete the offboarding of this collateral type.

Notice of this change was given by the Arbitration Facilitators [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605/51).

### Stability Fee Increases

Per this [post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/decentralized-collateral-scope-parameter-changes-1-april-2023/20302) from the Decentralized Collateral Scope Facilitators, in keeping with the [Decentralized Collateral Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104), the following Stability Fee Increases will take place, if this executive proposal passes:

* Increase the WBTC-A Stability Fee by 3.15% from 1.75% to **4.90%**.
* Increase the WBTC-B Stability Fee by 1.65% from 3.25% to **4.90%**.
* Increase the WBTC-C Stability Fee by 3.90% from 1% to **4.90%**.
* Increase the GNO-A Stability Fee by 2.40% from 2.5% to **4.90%**.

### Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`) Reductions

As per this successful [governance poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmPwHhLT), YFI-A, LINK-A, MATIC-A, and UNIV2USDCETH-A vaults will be offboarded from the Maker Protocol. As the first step of this process, per [MIP62](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP62), the Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`) for YFI-A, LINK-A, and MATIC-A will be set to **0 DAI**, if this executive proposal passes.

*Note:* the Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`) for UNIV2USDCETH-A is already set to 0 DAI.

### Coinbase Custody Legal Agreement Ratification

As per this successful [governance poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmdRELY7), RWA014 (Coinbase Custody) will be onboarded to the Maker Protocol. Ratification of the legal agreements and Draft Instruction Sets through a Maker Executive Vote is a prerequisite to the creation of relevant accounts with Coinbase Custody by James Asset Trust 3.

If this executive proposal passes, the Draft Instruction Sets will be considered "approved", which will permit the creation of relevant accounts, and the technical work to complete the onboarding will proceed once this has taken place.

Please review the legal assessment and Draft Instruction Sets from the Strategic Finance Core Unit prior to voting on the forum [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-custody-legal-assessment/20384) and on IPFS [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPTZKBagKKmYqVWytNb8Q9xL1LhsNVuueJLiLK2rMyHxh).
